# MyData Austria Hub Application


## Would you like to establish a Local Hub or Thematic Group?
Local hub
Comments:
* start with a Local Hub covering the Austrian geographic area with a strong focus on developing a roadmap; if this is successful we can start a Thematic Group afterwards
* the MyData Austria Hub is not a legal entity for now but a group of people interested in promoting MyData


## Contact email
info@mydatahub.at


## Twitter, Facebook, other social media, personal website (if available)

Comments:
* Christoph: I’d prefer to setup a meetup page and point to this website instead; from the past I know that keeping a webpage up-to-date is hard and with meetup.com we would get an established infrastructure

## Comments:
* from the response of our initial contact with MyData to found MyData Austria Hub:
“An Initiative need to appoint a Coordinator and share their contact information with MyData Global team for publication. The Coordinator should be a member of MyData Global. The Coordinator will be the main representative of an Initiative, and his/her primary role will be to develop and maintain the strategy for the Initiative together with its participants.”
